Due to the circumstances, we are moving to a fully virtual event and cancelling the physical event in Kaiserslautern

As we have already prepared infrastructure for remote participation, this will not be a major hurdle for the conference. We have contacted all remaining local participants and have made plans to shift all aspects of the conference online. Instructions on how to participate remotely which were sent out several days ago, remain un-changed. We will be tweaking the program to accommodate the new situation, so please look out for small changes.

We are truly saddened by this but are looking forward to having a fruitful online event.
