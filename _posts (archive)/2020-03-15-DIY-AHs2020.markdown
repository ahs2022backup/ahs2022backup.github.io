Are you excited about AHs2020, but miss the many comforts of physical conferences such as paper programs, lanyards and excessive signage?

Don't worry! We have your back.

You can download your print friendly program <a href="https://augmented-humans.org/img/print/Program_AHs_Print_Version.pdf"> HERE </a>. Note that it also doubles as a conference badge! However, we do not have student volunteers to check your badge. You will need to do that yourself.

We also have a smartphone friendly version. You can download it <a href="https://augmented-humans.org/img/print/Program_AHs_Web_Version.pdf"> HERE </a>, so you can check the program, while participating online.

Finally, for those who want to maximize their experience, we also have conference signs. You can download it <a href="https://augmented-humans.org/img/print/ConferenceSign.pdf"> HERE</a>. If you print it out, make sure to send us a picture of your own cosy litle AHs2020 event!
						
We also have provided helpful instructions on how to use these accessories:

See you all (virtually) soon.
